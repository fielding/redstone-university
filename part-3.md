a# Part III: The Automated Computer - Bringing It to Life

Incredible work on completing Part II. Our machine is now truly impressive. It has a powerful, versatile Arithmetic Logic Unit that can perform multiple types of calculations, and a robust display system capable of showing any result. We have built a genuine, manually-operated calculator.

But a computer is more than a calculator. It doesn't wait for a human to press buttons for every single step. A true computer can follow a list of instructions—a program—all on its own.

In Part III, we give our machine a soul. The theme for this part is **Automation**. We are going to build the final components that separate a static calculator from a dynamic, living computer. We will give it a memory to hold its thoughts and a heartbeat to drive it forward.

### Our Mission for Part III

This part will see us construct the final pieces of the puzzle and assemble them into a single, cohesive, self-running system.

*   **In Module 7 (Memory),** we will tackle the concept of "state." We will build circuits called latches that can remember a value, giving our computer a "scratchpad" to store the results of its calculations. This is the foundation of computer RAM.
*   **In Module 8 (The Heartbeat & Conductor),** we will perform the grand assembly. We'll build a clock to provide a steady pulse that synchronizes every component, and a Program Counter to automatically step through a sequence of hard-coded instructions. We will take our hands off the levers and watch our creation execute a program for the first time.

By the end of this Part, you will have achieved the ultimate goal of this course. You will have taken a collection of simple switches and logic gates and orchestrated them into a machine that can run a program without your intervention. This is where all our work comes together.

Let's begin Module 7 and give our computer a memory.

# Part IV: Post-Graduate Studies - Advanced Engineering

Congratulations, graduate of Redstone University! You have successfully completed the core curriculum. You have designed and built a fully operational, programmable 4-bit computer from scratch. You understand its number system, its logic, its processor, its memory, and the clock that brings it all to life. This is a monumental achievement.

The main course is over, but for those who are hungry for a greater challenge, the university offers a post-graduate program.

In Part IV, we will tackle an advanced engineering problem that we sidestepped earlier for the sake of efficiency. This bonus content is designed to stretch your skills and show you the kind of complexity required to make computers perfectly align with human expectations.

### Our Mission for Part IV

This special section contains a single, challenging module that will test everything you've learned.

*   **In Module 9 (The "Real World" Display),** we will finally solve the problem we encountered back in Module 4: how to display a number like "13" using two separate decimal digits. We chose the elegant programmer's solution of Hexadecimal, but now we will build the complex engineer's solution used in real-world calculators and digital clocks: the Double Dabble algorithm. This will require building our most intricate circuit yet, a dedicated Binary-to-BCD converter.

This final module is not for the faint of heart. It is a true capstone project that will result in the most "human-friendly" version of our computer. It's the perfect challenge for those who looked at their completed computer and asked, "What's next?"

Welcome to advanced studies. Let's dive into Module 9.
