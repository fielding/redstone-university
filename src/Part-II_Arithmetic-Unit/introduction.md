# Part II: The Processor Core - Giving Our Machine a Brain

Congratulations on completing Part I! Take a moment to appreciate what you've built. You have a fully functional I/O system: a 4-bit register to input numbers and a beautiful two-stage display that can show the results. You've mastered the theory of Boolean logic and applied it to a complex, real-world circuit.

But right now, our machine is just a fancy passthrough. It can display a number, but it can't *do* anything with it. It has a mouth and ears, but no brain.

In Part II, we build the brain. The theme for this part is the **Processor Core**. We are going to engineer the circuits that allow our computer to perform calculations, make logical comparisons, and truly process information.

### Our Mission for Part II

This part of the course is a story of engineering, problem-solving, and upgrading. We will follow a narrative path that mirrors the real-world process of system design.

*   **In Module 4 (The Adder & The First "Bug"),** we will give our computer its first mathematical ability: addition. In doing so, we will immediately run into a critical problem where our display fails, teaching us a valuable lesson about system limitations.
*   **In Module 5 (The Hexadecimal Upgrade),** we will solve the bug we discovered. But instead of a clumsy patch, we will learn about the programmer's language of Hexadecimal and perform an elegant upgrade to our display system, demonstrating the power of the modular design we created in Part I.
*   **In Module 6 (The ALU),** we will assemble all our logic and arithmetic circuits into a single, versatile component: the Arithmetic Logic Unit, or ALU. This is the true heart of any CPU, and we will build a control panel that allows us to command it to perform different functions on demand.

By the end of this Part, our machine will have evolved from a simple display device into a genuine calculator. You've built the chassis and the dashboard; now it's time to build the engine.

Let's dive into Module 4 and make our computer calculate.
