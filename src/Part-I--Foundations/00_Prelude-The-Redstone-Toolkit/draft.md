### Prelude: The Redstone Toolkit (Optional)


**TODO:** create this module

*   **Keep it Focused:** The goal is not to teach all of Minecraft. It's to provide a "Minimum Viable Knowledge" guide. We should cover:
    1.  **The Absolute Basics:** What is a block? How do you place and break one?
    2.  **The Core Components:** A visual guide to each key component used in the course.
        *   **Redstone Dust:** How it transmits power, its 15-block limit.
        *   **Redstone Torch:** How it provides power and, crucially, how it *inverts* a signal when placed on the side of a powered block.
        *   **Lever/Button:** The basic input switches.
        *   **Redstone Lamp:** The basic output indicator.
        *   **Redstone Repeater:** Its two primary functionsâ€”extending a signal past 15 blocks and acting as a one-way diode.
    3.  **Powering Blocks:** The concept of "strong" vs. "weak" power, and how a powered block can activate adjacent components.
