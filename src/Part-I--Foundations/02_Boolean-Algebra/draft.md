#### Module Introduction

Welcome back to Redstone University!

In our last module, we built a physical way to speak to our computer in binary. We have our keyboard—a set of four simple levers. But right now, those levers are connected to nothing. Our machine can't yet *understand* or *do* anything with the numbers we give it. It can hear us, but it doesn't know the language.

In this module, we're going to give our computer a mind. We're going to take a crucial journey into theory to learn the fundamental grammar of all digital logic. This isn't just a Minecraft lesson; this is the language that powers every computer chip ever made.

Welcome to Boolean Algebra.

#### Lesson 2.1: The Rules of Thought

In the mid-1800s, a mathematician named George Boole developed a new kind of algebra. Unlike the algebra you might know from school—where variables like `x` and `y` can be any number—Boole's variables were much simpler. They could only have two possible values: **True** or **False**.

This system, now called **Boolean Algebra**, was initially a mathematical curiosity. But a century later, when engineers started building the first electronic computers with on/off switches, they realized Boole had already invented the perfect mathematical system to describe them.

*   **The Core Idea:** We'll treat our Redstone signals as Boolean variables.
*   A powered Redstone line is **True**. We'll also call this `1`.
*   An unpowered Redstone line is **False**. We'll also call this `0`.

Boolean algebra gives us a set of rules and operators to manipulate these True/False values. These physical operators are called **logic gates**, and they are the bedrock (pun intended) of all computation.

#### Lesson 2.2: The Core Operators (The Verbs of Logic)

For each operator, we'll follow a consistent structure to build our knowledge from theory to practice:
*   **Formal Definition:** The high-level concept and official terminology.
*   **Symbols:** The common ways this operator is written in logic and programming.
*   **The Rule:** A plain-English sentence describing what the gate does.
*   **The Truth Table:** A complete chart defining the gate's behavior. This is the ultimate "source of truth."
*   **The Boolean Expression:** The algebraic representation of the gate's output.
*   **The Minecraft Gate:** An ASCII schematic and step-by-step guide to build a standard, compact version.
*   **Lab & Experiment:** A hands-on test to verify the gate's function against its truth table.
*   **Real-World Connection:** An example of where this logic is used in real technology.

##### Operator 1: NOT (The Inverter)

*   **Formal Definition:** The NOT gate, or Inverter, performs **Negation**. It's the simplest possible operation: it takes a single input and outputs its exact opposite.
*   **Symbols:** `¬A` (logic), `!A` (programming).
*   **The Rule:** If the input is `True`, the output is `False`. If the input is `False`, the output is `True`.
*   **The Truth Table:**
    | Input A | Output !A |
    |:-------:|:---------:|
    |    0    |     1     |
    |    1    |     0     |
*   **The Boolean Expression:** The output `Y` is simply `Y = !A`.
*   **The Minecraft Gate:** The **Redstone Torch** is a purpose-built NOT gate.
*   **ASCII Schematic:**
    ```
    Input A --- [Block] --- [Torch] ---> Output Y
    ```
*   **Lab & Experiment:**
    1.  Build the circuit as shown in the schematic, using a lever for Input A and a lamp for Output Y.
    2.  Set lever A to OFF (0). Observe that the lamp is ON (1).
    3.  Set lever A to ON (1). Observe that the lamp is OFF (0).
    4.  **Verification:** The physical results perfectly match the truth table. You've built a working inverter!
*   **Real-World Connection:** NOT gates are used everywhere, from creating the oscillating signal in a computer's clock (a "heartbeat") to flipping bits for representing negative numbers, which we'll do in a later module!

##### Operator 2: OR (The "At Least One" Gate)

*   **Formal Definition:** The OR gate performs **Disjunction**. Think of it as the optimistic gate. It checks if *at least one* of its inputs is True.
*   **Symbols:** `A V B` (logic), `A || B` (programming).
*   **The Rule:** The output is `True` if `A` is True, OR `B` is True, or if both are True.
*   **The Truth Table:**
    | Input A | Input B | Output A OR B |
    |:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
    |    0    |    0    |       0       |
    |    0    |    1    |       1       |
    |    1    |    0    |       1       |
    |    1    |    1    |       1       |
*   **The Boolean Expression:** The output `Y` is `Y = A OR B`.
*   **The Minecraft Gate:** The logic is inherent to how **Redstone Dust** works.
*   **ASCII Schematic:**
    ```
    Input A ---<Dust>---.
                       |
                        '---<Merged Dust>---> Output Y
                       |
    Input B ---<Dust>---'
    ```
*   **Lab & Experiment:**
    1.  Build the circuit, using two levers for Inputs A and B, and a lamp for Output Y.
    2.  Test all four combinations from the truth table (`0,0`, `0,1`, `1,0`, `1,1`).
    3.  **Verification:** Confirm that the lamp's state matches the output column of the truth table for every test.
*   **Real-World Connection:** A simple security system in your house might sound an alarm if the `FrontDoorSensor=True` OR the `BackDoorSensor=True`.

##### Operator 3: AND (The "Strict" Gate)

*   **Formal Definition:** The AND gate performs **Conjunction**. Think of it as the strict gate. It checks if *all* of its inputs are True.
*   **Symbols:** `A ∧ B` (logic), `A && B` (programming).
*   **The Rule:** The output is `True` *only if* `A` is True AND `B` is True.
*   **The Truth Table:**
    | Input A | Input B | Output A AND B |
    |:-------:|:-------:|:--------------:|
    |    0    |    0    |        0       |
    |    0    |    1    |        0       |
    |    1    |    0    |        0       |
    |    1    |    1    |        1       |
*   **The Boolean Expression:** The output `Y` is `Y = A AND B`. As we will prove in the next lesson, the circuit we're building implements `!(!A OR !B)`, which is logically equivalent.
*   **The Minecraft Gate: Our First Puzzle.** Unlike NOT and OR, we must construct the AND gate. This classic, compact torch-based design is a fundamental Redstone circuit.
*   **ASCII Schematic (Top-Down View):**
    ```
      Input A --- [Block] --- [Side Torch] -----.
                                          |
                                        [Central Block] ---- [Output Torch] ---> Output Y
                                          |
      Input B --- [Block] --- [Side Torch] -----'
    ```
*   **Lab & Experiment:**
    1.  Build the circuit as shown. The inputs `A` and `B` power the blocks that the two "Side Torches" are attached to. The "Output Torch" is attached to the "Central Block". The output `Y` is the signal from this final torch.
    2.  Test all four combinations from the truth table.
    3.  **Verification:** The output lamp should only light up when both input levers are ON.
*   **Real-World Connection:** A missile launch system might require `TurnKey1=True` AND `PressButton=True` to activate. Your computer's CPU uses an AND gate as an "Enable" signal, allowing a component to run only when it's told to *and* the data is ready.

#### Lesson 2.3: The Laws of Logic & The Power of Simplification

Just like `2 + x = x + 2` in normal algebra, Boolean algebra has laws that let us rearrange and simplify expressions. For us, **a simpler expression means a smaller, faster, and more reliable Redstone circuit.** This is a critical engineering skill.

*   **Identity Law:** `A OR 0 = A` and `A AND 1 = A`.
*   **Annihilator Law:** `A OR 1 = 1` and `A AND 0 = 0`.
*   **De Morgan's Law:** This is the superstar. It gives us a way to convert between ANDs and ORs by distributing a NOT operation and flipping the operator.
    *   `!(A AND B)` is the same as `!A OR !B`
    *   `!(A OR B)` is the same as `!A AND !B`
*   **Lab: The Proof in Practice**
    Let's use De Morgan's Law to prove our AND gate design is correct.
    1.  The two side torches are NOT gates on our inputs, giving us `!A` and `!B`.
    2.  Their signals merge into the central block, which is an OR gate (`!A OR !B`).
    3.  The final output torch is a NOT gate on that signal.
    4.  Therefore, the full expression for our circuit is `!(!A OR !B)`.
    5.  Applying De Morgan's Law to the part in the parentheses: `!A OR !B` is the same as `!(A AND B)`.
    6.  Substituting that back in, our expression becomes `!(!(A AND B))`.
    7.  The two NOTs (`!!`) cancel each other out, leaving `A AND B`. We used formal logic to prove our physical circuit is correct!

#### Lesson 2.4: The Negated Gates – NAND, NOR, and XNOR

There are three other gates that are simply the negated versions of the ones we've learned. They are incredibly important in real-world chip design.

*   **NAND (NOT-AND):** The output is `!(A AND B)`. It's `True` in all cases *except* when A and B are both True.
    *   **Challenge:** Look at our AND gate schematic from Lesson 2.2. Can you see how removing the final output torch creates a compact NAND gate? NAND gates are "functionally complete," meaning you can build every other logic gate using only NANDs! This is a fundamental principle of chip manufacturing.
*   **NOR (NOT-OR):** The output is `!(A OR B)`. It's `True` only when A and B are both False.
    *   **Challenge:** How would you build a NOR gate in Minecraft? (Hint: It's an OR gate followed by a NOT gate. A simple implementation is two dust lines powering a block with a torch on the front).
*   **XNOR (Exclusive-NOR):** The output is `!(A XOR B)`.
    *   **The Rule:** The output is `True` only when A and B are the **same**. This makes it a very useful **"Equality Detector."**
    *   **Foreshadowing:** We will use this powerful gate in our final ALU to check if two numbers are equal!

---

#### Lesson 2.5: The Special Operator – XOR

*   **Formal Definition:** The **Exclusive OR (XOR)** gate is our "difference detector." It's fundamental to computer arithmetic.
*   **Symbols:** `A ⊕ B` (logic), `A ^ B` (programming).
*   **The Rule:** The output is `True` *only if* the inputs are different from each other.
*   **The Truth Table:**
    | Input A | Input B | Output A XOR B |
    |:-------:|:-------:|:--------------:|
    |    0    |    0    |        0       |
    |    0    |    1    |        1       |
    |    1    |    0    |        1       |
    |    1    |    1    |        0       |
*   **The Boolean Expression:** The most direct representation is `(A AND !B) OR (!A AND B)`.
*   **The Minecraft Gate:** For our course, we will use the standard, compact design below to ensure consistency.
*   **ASCII Schematic (Side View):**
    ```
                           .--- [Repeater] ---.
                           |                  |
      Input A --- [Block] ---+-- [Torch]        '--> [Dust] --> Output Y
                           |                  |
                           '--- [Repeater] ---.
                                              |
      Input B --- [Block] ---+-- [Torch]        '--> [Dust] ---'
                           |                  |
                           '------------------'
    ```
    (Note: This is one of many compact XOR designs. The key is that the torches and repeaters interact to only allow a signal through when the inputs are different.)
*   **Lab & Experiment:** Build the provided XOR gate and test all four truth table combinations to verify its behavior.
*   **Foreshadowing:** The XOR gate is the magic ingredient in addition. It tells you the sum bit while ignoring the carry, as we will see in a later module.

#### Lesson 2.6: Software Superpowers – The XOR Trick for Programmers

This is where our hardware knowledge directly translates into writing brilliant, efficient software. The XOR gate has two magical properties that programmers exploit constantly:
1.  Any number XORed with itself is zero: `x ^ x = 0`.
2.  Any number XORed with zero is itself: `x ^ 0 = x`.

These two rules allow for an incredibly elegant solution to a whole class of programming interview problems on sites like LeetCode.

**The "Single Number" Problem:**
*   **The Challenge:** You are given a list of numbers where every number appears exactly twice, except for one number that appears only once. Find that unique number.
*   **Example List:** `[4, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
*   **The XOR Solution:** If you XOR all the numbers together, the pairs cancel themselves into nothing, leaving only the unique number! `4 ^ (1 ^ 1) ^ (2 ^ 2)` becomes `4 ^ 0 ^ 0`, which is `4`.

**The Code:**
```python
def findSingleNumber(nums):
  # Start with 0, the identity for XOR
  unique_number = 0
  # XOR every number in the list
  for n in nums:
    unique_number ^= n
  return unique_number
```
**The "Missing Number" Problem:**
*   **The Challenge:** You have a list containing every number from 0 to `n`, except one is missing. Find the missing number.
*   **The XOR Solution:** You can XOR all the numbers you *expect* to see (0 to n) with all the numbers you *actually* see in the list. The number that doesn't have a pair is the one that's missing.

This is a powerful bridge between hardware and software. The simple "difference detector" we built in Minecraft is the logical foundation for solving complex algorithmic problems with extreme efficiency.

#### Lesson 2.7: Module 2 Checkpoint

- **Quiz:**
    1. What is the output of `(1 AND 0) OR (1 XOR 1)`? (Answer: 0)
    2. If `A=0` and `B=1`, what is `!(A OR B)`? (This is a NOR gate. Answer: 0)
    3. Which logic gate acts as an "Equality Detector"? (XNOR).

- **Debug Challenge ("Module 2.5"):**
    > In the world download, you'll find a section labeled "Module 2 Debug Challenge." I've built a circuit that is *supposed* to implement the logic `(A AND B) OR C`, but it's giving the wrong output for some inputs! Your mission is to use your knowledge of truth tables to diagnose the mistake in the wiring and fix it.

### Module 2 Conclusion

This was a huge module! But you now have the most powerful tool an engineer can possess: a formal language to describe, design, and simplify complex systems. You know the "verbs" of logic, have built them, and seen how that physical logic directly empowers elegant software solutions. In the next module, we'll use this newfound language to build our first truly complex and useful machine: a translator that will let our computer speak to us.
