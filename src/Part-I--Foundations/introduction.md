# Part I: The Foundations, Speaking to the Machine

Welcome to Part I of Redstone University’s epic journey to build a working computer from scratch! Our grand ambition is to create a fully functional machine, but every masterpiece starts with a strong foundation. In this part, we’re diving into the Human-Computer Interface, the critical components that let us (as humans) communicate with our digital creation.

By the end of Part I, our computer won’t be thinking on its own yet, but it will have a complete input and output system. You’ll be able to send it numbers and see those numbers displayed in a way that’s instantly clear to you. This is where the magic begins!

## Our Mission for Part I

We’ll conquer this foundation in three exciting modules, blending hands-on building with powerful theory and culminating in a show-stopping application:

- **Module 1: The Input Register**
  Build the computer’s keyboard, a simple set of levers to input numbers in binary (the machine’s native language).

- **Module 2: Boolean Algebra**
  Take a crucial dive into the theory that powers all digital logic. This is the course’s most important lecture, where you’ll master the grammar of NOT, AND, OR, and XOR, the rules behind every circuit you’ll design.

- **Module 3: Decoders and Displays**
  Apply your new theoretical skills to a major challenge: creating a two-stage translator that converts binary into human-readable numbers on a stunning 7-segment display.

This part is crafted to deliver a thrilling payoff. You’ll start with basic switches and end with a device that feels alive. These concepts are the bedrock (pun intended) for everything to come.

## Why This Progression?

I’ve designed this course to spark your motivation early. Personally, I wanted to see my inputs and outputs light up on a 7-segment display to confirm my work was correct. It made the abstract ideas of binary and logic feel real and rewarding. That’s why we begin with the input register and quickly move to the display. It’s a tangible goal that keeps you hooked.

This approach mirrors a core belief about learning to code or build: the faster you see something working, the more driven you’ll be to push forward. Part I is all about giving you that instant sense of progress and accomplishment.
