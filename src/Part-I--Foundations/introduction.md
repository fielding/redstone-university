# Part I: The Foundations - Speaking to the Machine

Welcome to the first official part of our Redstone University curriculum! The grand goal is to build a complete computer, but like any great project, we must begin by laying a solid foundation. The theme for this part is the **Human-Computer Interface**: we are going to build the essential components that allow us, as humans, to communicate with our digital machine.


By the end of Part I, our computer won't be able to think for itself yet, but we will have a fully functional input and output system. We'll have a way to give it numbers and a way for it to show us numbers back in a format we can instantly recognize.

### Our Mission for Part I

We will tackle this in three distinct modules, moving from the physical to the theoretical, and back to a large-scale physical application.

*   **In Module 1 (The Input Register),** we will build our "keyboard." It's a simple set of levers that will allow us to input numbers into our machine using the computer's native language: binary.
*   **In Module 2 (Boolean Algebra),** we will take a crucial detour into theory. This is the most important "lecture" in the entire course. We will learn the fundamental grammar of all digital logicâ€”the rules of NOT, AND, OR, and XOR that govern every circuit we will ever build.
*   **In Module 3 (Decoders & Displays),** we will take our new theoretical knowledge and immediately apply it to our biggest challenge yet: building a way to display our input and output. We'll engineer a sophisticated two-stage translator that converts the computer's binary into a human-readable number on a beautiful 7-segment display.

This first part of the course is designed to give you an incredibly satisfying payoff. You will start with nothing but switches and end with a device that feels intelligent. The concepts you learn here are the bedrock (pun intended) upon which everything else will be built.

> **Note about the chosen course progression:** I personally found myself wanting to build a 7-segment display to verify that everything past this point in the course was working correctly. I wanted to see the numbers I was entering, and I wanted to see the results of my calculations. This is why we start with the input register and then immediately build the display. It gives us a tangible goal to work towards, and it makes the abstract concepts of binary and logic feel real and rewarding.

> This also follows a personal belief about learning to program: The quicker you can get something moving on screen, the more motivated you will be to keep going. I want you to have that immediate sense of progress and accomplishment.

Let's get started with Module 1.
