## About The Project

Have you ever used a computer and wondered what’s *really* happening inside? Not just the software, but the deep, physical magic behind it all?

**Redstone University** is a journey into the heart of the machine. This project provides a complete, university-level curriculum for learning computer architecture from first principles. But instead of abstract Hardware Description Languages and simulators, our campus is the world of Minecraft. We will make the abstract tangible, turning theory into a physical, working machine that you can walk around inside of.

As a self-taught computer engineer, I found myself wanting to explore the foundational principles of computer science. The initial spark for this project, however, came from wanting to build something that could share these incredible ideas with my daughter, Ada. Ada introduced me to minecraft when she was 2 years old, and we've been building together ever since. I realized that the abstract concepts of binary, bitwise operations, logic gates, and computer architecture are sometimes introduced in ways that make them feel very intangible. At the same time, I saw the incredibly complex and logical machines being built in Minecraft with Redstone. The idea was born: **what if we could learn these concepts in a tangible way, by building a computer from scratch, using tools we already love?**

### Who Is This For?

This course is for the curious. It's for:
*   **My daughter, Ada**, for whom this project was first imagined.
*   **Students and kids** who want a fun, hands-on introduction to STEM and computer science.
*   **University CS students** who want a physical way to visualize the concepts from their "Computer Architecture" class.
*   **Self-taught programmers and professionals** who want to solidify their understanding of what's happening at the hardware level.
