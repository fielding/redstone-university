#### Key Terms (Module 2)

-   **Boolean Algebra:** A branch of mathematics for working with true/false values (1/0), using operators like AND, OR, and NOT.
-   **Logic Gate:** A physical or virtual device that implements a Boolean operation.
-   **Primitive Gate:** A basic, indivisible logic gate from which more complex gates are built. In our course, these are NOT and OR.
-   **Composite Gate:** A logic gate constructed by combining primitive gates (e.g., an AND gate built from NOT and OR gates).
-   **Truth Table:** A chart showing all possible input/output combinations for a logic gate or circuit.
-   **Diode**: A component that allows an electrical signal to pass in only one direction. In Minecraft, the Redstone Repeater acts as a perfect diode.
-   **Functionally Complete:** A set of gates from which any Boolean function can be built (e.g., just NAND or just NOR).
-   **Bitwise Operation:** A software operation that manipulates individual bits of a number.
-   **XOR (Exclusive OR):** Outputs 1 if inputs are different; used in both hardware and software for unique logic tricks.
