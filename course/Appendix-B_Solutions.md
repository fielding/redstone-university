#### Solution for #### **Lesson 2.5: Software Superpowers â€“ The XOR Trick for Programmers**

---

**The Logic:**

The core idea is to XOR all the numbers that *should* be in the list against all the numbers that *are* actually in the list.

1.  First, we calculate the XOR sum of the complete sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`. For our example `[3, 0, 1]`, `n` is 3, so this would be `0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3`.
2.  Next, we calculate the XOR sum of the numbers in the list we were given: `3 ^ 0 ^ 1`.
3.  If we XOR these two results together, all the numbers that are present in both lists will pair up and cancel out, leaving only the number that was missing from the input list.

`(0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3) ^ (3 ^ 0 ^ 1)` can be rearranged as `(0^0) ^ (1^1) ^ (3^3) ^ 2`, which simplifies to `2`.

**The Python Code:**

```python
def missingNumber(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    expected_xor_sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        expected_xor_sum ^= i

    actual_xor_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        actual_xor_sum ^= num

    return expected_xor_sum ^ actual_xor_sum
```
