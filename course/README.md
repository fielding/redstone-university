# Welcome to Redstone University!

Have you ever used a computer or a smartphone and wondered what’s *really* happening inside? Not just the software, but the deep, physical magic of a machine that seems to "think"?

This isn't just another Minecraft course. This is a journey into the heart of the machine.

My name is [Your Name], and as an engineer [and a parent!], I found myself wanting to explore the foundational principles of computer science. I realized that the abstract concepts of binary, logic gates, and computer architecture were difficult to grasp from books alone. At the same time, I saw the incredibly complex and logical machines being built in Minecraft with Redstone. The idea was born: **what if we could learn how a computer works by building one from scratch, using tools we already love?**

That is the mission of Redstone University. We will make the abstract tangible. We will turn theory into a physical, working machine that you can walk around inside of.

### The Journey Ahead

This course is structured as a complete curriculum, taking you from zero knowledge to a fully functional, programmable 4-bit computer. We will follow a clear, logical path, broken into five distinct parts:

*   **Part I: The Foundations - Speaking to the Machine.** We will begin by building the essential human-computer interface. We'll learn the language of binary, the grammar of Boolean logic, and construct our own "keyboard" and "monitor."
*   **Part II: Engineering a Robust Arithmetic Unit.** Here, we will build the mathematical core of our machine. We'll engineer an adder and subtractor, discover our machine's natural limitations through "bugs" like overflow, and upgrade our system to solve them, just like real engineers.
*   **Part III: The Processor Core.** With our arithmetic unit perfected, we will forge the true brain of our computer: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). We will combine all our mathematical and logical circuits into one powerful, versatile, and controllable component.
*   **Part IV: Creating an Automated Computer.** In the final core modules, we'll give our processor a memory to store its thoughts and a clock to act as its heartbeat. We will assemble everything into a single, automated machine that can run a simple program on its own.
*   **Part V: Post-Graduate Studies.** For those who want to go even further, we'll explore advanced topics, tackling the complex challenge of making our computer display multi-digit decimal numbers, just like a real-world calculator.

### Who Is This For?

This course is for the curious. It's for:
*   **My daughter, Ada**, for whom this project was first imagined.
*   **Students and kids** who want a fun, hands-on introduction to STEM and computer science.
*   **University CS students** who want a physical way to visualize the concepts from their "Computer Architecture" class.
*   **Self-taught programmers and professionals** who want to solidify their understanding of what's happening at the hardware level.

### How to Get Started & Accessibility

This course is designed to be followed along in **Minecraft**. However, Minecraft is not strictly required!

For each module, I will provide guidance, but I also provide a **World Download**—the "RU Campus"—with the completed circuits. You can use this to check your work, explore the final product, or use the pre-built components as "black boxes" if you want to focus more on the high-level concepts.

**The "No-Minecraft Track":** If you don't have Minecraft or prefer a more theoretical approach, you can still complete this entire course. Every lesson will include text descriptions, diagrams, and schematics. We will also provide links to free online digital logic simulators (like [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/simulator)) where you can build and test these circuits without the game. The core learning is in the logic, not just the blocks.

Thank you for enrolling. It's time to stop just *using* computers and start *understanding* them.

Let's build a machine that thinks.
